# With this course I:
## Understood the importance of GIT for programmers
### Organization is essential.
### Keeping your old code if any big mistakes are done in the correction process.
### It helps you work in groups in an wasier way providing tools such as pull requests or commits. 
## I didn't understand a few things
### Is it necessary to use GitHub desktop or using the [GitHub](github.com)  website is enough.
### When doing pull requests, how can my collaborators see mine, or how can I see theirs?
_**Even though there is a lot of stuff, tools, commands that I still don't know, I wanna keep learning new things to work in this amazing tool**_
